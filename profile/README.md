#Hello from Hoa Studio 🌸

## Architects of the Universal UI.

Hoa Studio is an open-source collective dedicated to solving the "framework silo" problem in frontend development. We believe a button in React should share the same soul as a button in Svelte—same accessibility, same behavior, same theme.

We built hoa-ui to prove that you don't need to rewrite your design system for every new JavaScript framework.

## 🛠 Our Stack & Philosophy

We build on the bleeding edge to deliver stability for others.

- Logic First: We rely on Ark UI state machines, not framework-specific spaghetti code.
- CSS Native: We embrace Tailwind CSS v4 for high-performance, compiled styling.
- Monorepo Native: Built with Bun and Turborepo for speed and scale.
